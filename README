The script allows to format a piece of latex text by splitting paragraphs according to latex keywords.

The main function, FormatLatexPar, formats the latex text to which the cursor belong, stopping above and below when a keyword is found, or when the vim paragraph ends. Then it moves at the end of the formatted section. If the current line is a comment, does the same thing, but searching for neighboring comments. The function is mapped to CTRL-j.

Note: have a look also at a similar scrip (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2307).

Todolist: merge multiple empty line into one.

Here is an example of text, and the resulting formatted text obtained by repeated calls of the function:

<EXAMPLE BEGIN>
This is an example of the latex formatting script: the paragraphs are
formatted
by taking into account special latex ending keywords, as any
\begin{something}
    or as,
    for example
\end{something}

Also
formulas
$$
    like this
    one
$$
are kept separated

Other separators are a line beginning
with
{
    as this one
}   
but others can be easily added

Also,
comments
% like this
% or this
% are merged

but not % if the comment is not at the beginning of the line
% as in this case.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Some commands, as item, are delimiters,
    but one may want
    to format them with the text.
    \item These are treated differently
    in the script
\end{itemize}

You can easily suit this script to your needs
changing SingleLineLatexParEndings and
MultiLineLatexParEndings functions.
<EXAMPLE END>

is formatted, by subsequent calls, into

<FORMATTED EXAMPLE BEGIN>
